        <h3>By: Stephanie Wong, April 2017</h3>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>
                Notuber is an web application that matches a client to black cabs that are
                available. The client will submit their username, longitude, and latitude to
                the application which will then return the username, longitude, and latitude of
                the 5 most recent black cab drivers and display them on the map.
        </h3>

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <h3>
                The first tests carried out were done in a "black box" manner, without seeing the source
                code. I used Postman to carry out POST and GET requests. I then reviewed the source code
                to look for more vulnerablities.
        </h3>

        <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
        <h3>
                The majority of the vulnerablities found came from trusting user input. User input is never
                validated and thus creates opportunities for exploitation.
        </h3>

        <h1>Issues found</h1>
        <h2> Database query injection:</h2>
        <h3>
                <p>
                        <li>
                                Location: the GET method /vehicle.json
                        </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                        <li>
                        Description: Queries are not validated, so by using MongoDB queries instead of strings,
                        i.e. using the input username[$ne]="swong02" to the path /vehicle.json
                        I was able to get the information of the first vehicle that was in the
                        database that did not have the username swong02.
                        </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                        <li>
                        Severity: medium, luckily, the implementation only used findOne instead of findAll, so only
                        the first document that matched the [$ne] was returned and not all of them.
                        </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                        <li>
                        Resolution: Sanitizing and validating the user input would fix this problem by
                        using the Validator module. The Validator module provided by NodeJS has a
                        function escape() that will validate all data and remove anything malicious
                        by replacing special characters with the HTML equivalent.

                                Location: the POST method /submit
                        </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                        <li>
                        Description: inputs are not validated, so by inserting a javascript script
                        i.e. "<code>alert("hacked")</code>" to the path /submit
                        I was able to insert this alert to the database so that every time someone
                        else accesses the "/" route, it was run
                        </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                        <li>
                        Severity: high, because instead of typing an alert script, one could have
                        inserted a redirect to another html that could potentially look like a login
                        page of some sort that the client could fall for and type in their details that would
                        then be sent back to the hacker's server and thus their information would all be leaked.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Description: Inputs are not validated so a hacker could potentiall spam and flood
                        the server with random inputs. Using a bash shell script, I flooded the database with random inputs
                        through curl. This could potentially flood the database, causing it to crash. The shell script
                        that I wrote was:

                        <li>
                        Severity: medium, this could just be harmless and doesn't do anything particularly malicious. But
                        by flooding the server, the website could crash.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Resolution: Have a system for verifying logins, like a CAPTCHA system or requiring users to
                        create an account.
