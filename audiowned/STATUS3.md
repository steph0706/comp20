# Comp 20 Team 14 Status Report 3
#### What we did this week:
- debugged authentication to spotify âœ“
- created loading page and matched pages (css animation)
- accessed user data (account pictures) and displayed them on matched page
- debugged internal error on heroku
- looked into ways to play/display songs
- discovered embedded spotify package (node)

#### Challenges & issues faced this week:
- finding and implementing different types of animation
- attempting to find a way to play songs and display them on the page, which
  was clarified during the lightning talks
- struggled with displaying user pictures after getting them back from spotify

#### What we want to accomplish next week:
- how to set time of each song for a player
- set up Mongo and set up the access and display of information, which will be
  the high scores of each category
- allow user to choose a level of difficulty & genres of music (Spotify API
  provides methods for that)

# Comments by Ming
* accidentally committed 40+ times => not a problem
* debug internal error on heroku => what happened here?
* definitely top two priorities:
- set up Mongo and set up the access and display of information, which will be
  the high scores of each category
- allow user to choose a level of difficulty & genres of music (Spotify API
  provides methods for that)
