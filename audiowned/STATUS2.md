# Comp 20 Team 14 Status Report 2
#### What we did this week: 
- accidentally committed 40+ times
- authentication to spotify âœ“
- set up redirect after authentication

#### Challenges & issues faced this week:
- how to serve dynamic content based on user's info
- our game involves timing, so we have to start the game at the same time for
  both players, otherwise one would have an advantage
 - debug after pushing to heroku 

#### What we want to accomplish next week:
- debug internal error on heroku
- use spotify API to fetch user data and store it in our database (mongo)
- allow user to choose a level of difficulty & genres of music (Spotify API
  provides methods for that)
- John's talk about templating was really helpful - we're going to look into 
  using pug.js or another templating engine to help solve the second point 
  described in the challenges section
