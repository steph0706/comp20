1. What is this purpose of this Git repository?
The purpose of this Git repository is to serve as a portfolio that documents all
the work that I've done in COMP20 - Web Programming.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favourite assignment was Assignment 3, which was the server-side of Not Uber.
Learning about the server side of web applications was really interesting and really
gave me a deeper (but of course incomplete) insight into how the web works.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think that I've grown a lot throughout this course. I came in with basically no
knowledge of the web and now I understand a lot more about how the web works. We
covered a lot of the fundamentals, from what happens when someone enters a url,
to how servers work behind the scenes to support websites.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I learned to explore and learn independently more efficiently. This course encouraged me to
Google answers (especially looking at StackOverflow) more which most other courses don't
really encourage. Also, instead of having rigid specifications on assignments, assignments
in this class had a lot more flexibility which allowed me to explore more things on my own
and build on assignments and ask questions.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
Web security was something that intrigued me a lot, and this topic has become very important
now that the web has become so fully integrated into peoples lives. Another aspect I'd
like to delve more into is building a website from scratch, especially using Javascript
and CSS to make websites more appealing and user-friendly.
